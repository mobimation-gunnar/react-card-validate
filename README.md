# react-card-validate

Another credit card input app.
This variant cares about supporting the user
during field input and is a bit chatty.  
It is implemented in Functional React.

It builds on a demo that combines two worthwhile
pieces of code;
* the "react-payments-input" component
* a piece of credit card rendering code  
 borrowed from "react-credit-card".

This app essentially derives everything  
from "react-credit-card" except ditching its  
"final-form" form implementation
in favor of "react-payments-input".

I used https://codesandbox.io/s/7kj0z?file=/components/PostCards.js
as inspiration.

This React project was bootstrapped using 'npx create-react-app'  
 and was configured to run on node version 18.12.1, an LTS version.
